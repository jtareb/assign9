It is classic, sophisticated, practical, handmade, and best of all, you can personalize it especially for him with up to 4 initials added for free. \r\n\r\nThis spacious bag is constructed of soft, top grain leather in our best-selling Whiskey-Carmel leather. The leather has a semi-aniline finish with a waxy hand to provide a beautiful look and added years of protection against wear and soiling. This toiletry bag is also fully lined in a water resistant nylon, which makes it easy to clean with a damp cloth. All seams are enclosed. \r\n\r\nAlso featured is a heavy duty YKK brass zipper closure and leather zipper pull. The wide zipper opening allows easy access to contents. Tabs on both ends make the bag easy to zip open and closed.\r\n\r\nEach bag is hand cut and custom embroidered before it is lined and stitched together with strong nylon thread on an industrial sewing machine. Every step is executed carefully so you will have a sturdy, well-constructed bag that will hold up to years of use.\r\n\r\nMeasures approximately: 8.5&quot; wide, 3.5&quot; tall, 4&quot; deep. \r\n\r\nThis toiletry bag is large enough to hold the essentials a guy might need. For a clearer picture, please see the last photograph for an idea of how much will fit into this bag.\r\n\r\nIf you want initials embroidered on the bag, please specify in &quot;comments to seller&quot; when you place your order. We&#39;re happy to make this bag personal! If you would like to order multiples, please select quantity, and let us know in the comments to seller how to initial each dopp kit. \r\n\r\nOPTIONAL UPGRADE:\r\nFor an additional $15, you can include a message up to 30 characters on the inside of the bag, in either block lettering or script lettering. \r\n\r\nBecause this is a hand-crafted product, every bag will be slightly different in terms of its color and texture, but comes with a guarantee of solid, consistent construction. Don&#39;t be fooled by other sellers who embroider commercially-made bags and then label them hand-made. Here at Felix Street Studio, we source our leather hides locally, cut all of our own leather, and produce all of our products from scratch. You can be sure that if you purchase from Felix Street, you are getting a quality product made from American materials by one of our talented in-house artisans. \r\n\r\nHappy with the design, but wish it was a little bigger?

We love what we do and appreciate the good karma involved in selling to people who love what we make.  Our goal is to make every transaction a fabulous experience, from initial order, to packaging, to your pleasure in using my handcrafted items.  Please contact me if you have any questions at all.  \r\n\r\nMy thoughts on pricing:  I am frequently approached about offering discounts, or selling  to retailers at wholesale prices.  My Etsy prices reflect a fair compensation for our time, talent, and materials.  I do not inflate my prices so that I can offer &quot;discounts&quot;.  Etsy provides a venue where I don&#39;t have to pay for additional middle-woman or distribution costs, and I prefer to pass that value on to my one-on-one customers.  So, please know that you are getting my very best pricing and although I am flattered by the requests, you will not see my bags in retail shops.","policy_payment":"If you request a custom listing, I expect the order\/payment process to be complete within 24 hours.  If I haven&#39;t heard from you by then I will assume you have made other arrangements and will delete your custom listing.  These delays cause all kinds of extra twiddling and fiddling and emailing and take me away from my sewing machine.\r\n\r\nI collect and report sales taxes on all sales within Arizona.","policy_shipping":"SHIPPING INFO:\r\nWe carefully select the most cost-effective packaging and keep it as light-weight as possible.  \r\n\r\nUpon purchasing an item from my shop, you will receive a confirmation from us with a promised shipping date. Shipping commitments are serious business here, and we keep our promises.  Please double-check the ship-to address before you order.  Obviously,we cannot honor delivery commitments if your provide the wrong address.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that handcrafted personalized goods are made after they are ordered. We are proud of our turn around times and we are fast.  But if you need your order by &quot;Friday&quot; please let us know so we can upgrade your order to RUSH\/Priority status and charge you accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter shipping thousands of packages, we have great confidence in the United States Postal Service.  However, sometimes a package is marked as delivered but does not make it into the buyer&#39;s possession - particularly when delivered to apartments.  When the US postal service tells us they have delivered the package to a correctly addressed location, we must assume theft.  Therefore, we do not issue refunds or replacements on orders identified by USPS as delivered.  \r\n\r\nWe will gladly ship to most countries.  However, we cannot  track your shipment or guarantee delivery.  Unfortunately, international packages do sometimes go astray once they leave the U.S.  \r\n\r\nInternational buyers - please see additional information below.","policy_refunds":"Again, I want you to be happy with your purchase from me.  I will jump through hoops to make that happen.  Let me know if you have any issues with my products and I will work with you to make it right.\r\n\r\nOrders cannot be returned or refunded unless the item is not as described in the listing or we have made a mistake.  In this rare event, your order will be promptly replaced.  Please read through my feedback to review the thousands of positive experiences with previous customers who left ratings.","policy_additional":"INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS - (UK CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY - PLEASE READ);\r\n\r\nBuyers are responsible for any in-bound duties\/VAT\/customs fees charged by their country.\r\n\r\nInternational customers are responsible for all import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. These fees and taxes and any additional charges for customs clearance are levied once a shipment reaches your country, and must be borne by the recipient. I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Please be aware that when customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond my original delivery estimates. All international orders will have full value declared on customs forms, and will be marked as &quot;merchandise&quot; - no exceptions.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1419348317,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/FelixStreetStudio?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/5151494\/iusb_760x100.14417363_amui.jpg","num_favorers":7021,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null}},{"listing_id":165749108,"state":"active","user_id":32660934,"category_id":68891054,"title":"Personalized Engraved Etched Scotch Whiskey Decanter Bottle Groomsmen, Man Cave, Just Married, Christmas Gift for Him (024559)","description":"This glass whiskey decanter makes the perfect gift for that classic gentlemen in your life.

We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.

It is precision engineered with UL listed components for years of reliable service. The premium components include a brass plated PUSH-THRU standard size (edison) bulb socket and IP lamp pipe, gold cord with molded plug, sturdy walnut stained 7&quot; x 4 3\/4&quot; oval wooden base, and non-slip base bumpers.\r\n\r\nThe lamp comes with a 3 watt 16 color LED bulb and wireless remote control. You can select any one of 16 colors and change them any time. It will always remember the last setting.\r\n\r\nYou can also choose the &quot;chase&quot; and &quot;fade&quot; options and sequence through the colors. This makes the lamp look really cool for more of a party type atmosphere. To see the bulb in action with the chase mode and get an idea of the different colors a video clip that we made can be found here: http:\/\/vzaar.tv\/2059229 \r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to use the included LED bulb, no problem. Just use the bulb of your choice. We suggest nothing larger than a standard 60W bulb or a CFL.\r\n\r\nIt does not include a lamp shade! This keeps the cost low and allows you to get one you like that fits your own style and decor. It uses a basic shade that does not require a harp or finial. There are many to choose from at the retail giant that begins with a &quot;W&quot; starting at only $5.00 and up to around $15.00. The ones for five bucks are perfect and really look great!\r\n\r\nThis lamp is NOT even close to similar poorly crafted &quot;cheap&quot; bottle lamps. It is for those who are looking for a premium design at a reasonable price. Just looking at the picture it&#39;s easy to see the difference in quality and workmanship. My lamps are so well made I include an unconditional lifetime warranty on every one! If it ever fails for any reason, I will repair or replace it at no charge! (Bulb not included).\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a beautiful table lamp that makes a great gift for yourself or a loved one. It is carefully packed and shipped in a brand new heavy-duty brown box that&#39;s suitable for wrapping. If you are giving this as a gift, there is nothing on the carton that identifies the contents. We are so confident that you will be happy with your lamp we offer a 60 day money back guarantee and will even pay for the return shipping so you have nothing to lose!\r\n\r\nPrice includes FREE SHIPPING anywhere in the continental U.S. (48 States). For international shipping, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, etc. contact me for a shipping quote before making your purchase.

The barrel hold 2 liters and is handcrafted from Kentucky and American Oak wood with steel hoops going around it (your choice of silver or black steel). You can use the barrel to store liquor OR to make your very own home blend. The process is simple and  perfect for either an experienced or novice home distiller. The barrel measures 7.5&quot; x 5&quot; x 5&quot; and comes with its own stand.\r\n\r\nI also sell the barrel in 1 liter size: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/101458387\/1-liter-personalized-mini-whiskey-barrel and 3 liter size: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/104334149\/3-liter-engraved-bourbon-barrel-great\r\n\r\nWHAT COMES WITH IT?\r\nAlong with each barrel, you&#39;ll get a set of detailed instructions that will have you creating and aging your own spirits at home in no time. Each barrel also comes with a wood carved stand.\r\n\r\nWHAT&#39;S THE PROCESS?\r\nBefore the barrel can be used, you&#39;ll have to perform the curing (cleaning) process. The included instructions will guide you through this very simple process. Once the barrel is cured you can fill it with your own favorite brand of bourbon or whiskey. If you want to enhance the flavor, you can also put some of your own favorite ingredients into the barrel. Favorite examples are cinnamon sticks, apple chips, honey and chocolate. The aging process can take anywhere from one week to three years -- it&#39;s all based on your personal taste preferences. Once you&#39;ve finished one batch, you can empty your creation into a decanter and restart the process. If you&#39;re not a big whiskey drinker, you can also use the barrels to blend or store your own wine, rum and tequila. \r\n\r\nENGRAVING OPTIONS:\r\nI will engrave the front of your barrel(s) at no extra cost. There is a visual example of the 4 engraving style in the product images above. Please select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. Your options are are:\r\n1. Standard Initials\r\n2. One or Two Custom Lines of Text (max of 15 characters per line)\r\n3. Single Large Initial\r\n4. Monogram (first name initial, last name initial, middle name initial)\r\n\r\n*You can also select blank and not have any engraving on the barrel.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SEND ME YOUR ENGRAVING REQUEST(S):\r\nPlease select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. When finalizing your order, you&#39;ll have the ability to include a &quot;message to seller&quot;. Use this area to tell me what you want engraved on your barrel(s). If I don&#39;t receive a message with your engraving request, it will be assumed you want your barrel to arrive without engraving.\r\n\r\nORDERING MORE THAN 1 BARREL?\r\nYou can select your quantity on this page or at checkout.\r\n\r\nSHIPMENT\r\nOrders are currently shipping out approximately 2-3 business days. After this, there are another 2-4 business days in transit via UPS Ground.

I&#39;ll always work with a customer to make sure their experience is a positive one.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to cancel a personalized order after it&#39;s placed, I can only do so if customization work hasn&#39;t started on the order. If this work has begun, I unfortunately won&#39;t be able to cancel or refund your order.\r\n\r\nNon-personalized items can be returned as long as they haven&#39;t been used. For these returns, the customer is responsible for paying return shipping. Once I have received the item(s) back, I will credit your Paypal account or credit card for the purchase price of the item(s).","policy_additional":"SHOP PRACTICES FAQ:\r\nQ - Are there discounts for bulk orders?\r\nA - Yes, I&#39;m always happy to offer bulk discounts if you&#39;re ordering several of one item or purchasing groomsmen gifts. Please message me for details.\r\n\r\nQ - Do you guarantee the lead and ship times listed above.\r\nA - I never guarantee a delivery date when an item ships via UPS Ground. This is because the activity on UPS&#39; end is out of my hands. If you need an item by a specific date, please contact me to discuss guaranteed options. We may need to add a rush to the order and use a shipping method quicker than Ground.\r\n\r\nQ - What is rush service and how much is it?\r\nA - Rush service cuts down the lead time for an order. Instead of the stated lead time for a product, the order will go out sooner with a rush. The fee for this is $20 due to the expedited work that has to be done on my end. Please contact me  BEFORE ORDERING to discuss placing a rush order.\r\n\r\nQ - How do I send you my personalization request(s)?\r\nA - Great question. If you&#39;re ordering an item that can be engraved or personalized in any way, please create a &quot;message to seller&quot; while checking out. You can write your personalization requests in this message. If I don&#39;t receive this message, it will be assumed you don&#39;t want any personalization for your order.\r\n\r\nQ - Is there an extra charge to ship to Hawaii or Alaska?\r\nA - Yes, I do charge a $20 fee for these orders due to high ship costs. I&#39;ll contact you after the order to arrange payment.\r\n\r\nQ - Can you ship to a PO box?\r\nA - Unfortunately, I cannot ship to PO boxes or APO addresses.\r\n\r\nBOURBON BARREL FAQ\r\nQ - I just received my barrel but the hoops are loose. What do I do?\r\nA - This is normal. Once the barrel is cured, it will expanding thus tightening the hoops. Detailed instructions for curing are included with every barrel.\r\n\r\nQ - Why does my barrel look slightly different from the ones in the product photos? OR I ordered several barrels and they all look slightly similar.\r\nA - Since no two pieces of wood are exactly alike, no two barrels will be exactly alike. The varying grain level and thickness of wood gives each barrel it&#39;s own unique, charming look.\r\n\r\nQ - What engraving font do you use on the barrels?\r\nA - Times New Roman Bold.\r\n\r\nQ - Can my engraving be done curved around the top and bottom of the barrel face?\r\nA - Unfortunately, not. The only engraving formats I&#39;m set up to do are listed on the product listing and featured in the product images.\r\n\r\nQ - Are the barrels charred?\r\nA - Yes, the barrels are charred with a medium level (2-3) char.\r\n\r\nQ - My barrel is leaking, what should I do?\r\nA - It&#39;s normal for a barrel that hasn&#39;t been cured to leak. Before using the barrel, you must first seal it by following the curing process that&#39;s detailed in the included instructions.\r\n\r\nQ - I filled my barrel but now it&#39;s empty!?!? What happened?\r\nA - Either someone in your home has been sneaking drinks OR you didn&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up as the instructions say to. If you don&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up, the top will get dry and evaporation will occur.\r\n\r\nQ - Why did my barrel turn a weird bluish looking color after curing it?\r\nA - This happens in less than 1% of barrels. The cause is related to the the ions in water negatively reacting to the metal thus the black bleeding onto the barrel.  There is no health risk, but please contact me if this occurs. \r\n\r\nCHALKBOARD MUG FAQ\r\nQ - If I  buy a chalkboard mug, can you write a message on it for me?\r\nA - We&#39;ve attempted to include chalk-written messages on mugs in the past, but the writing does smudge during shipping. We&#39;re happy to try -- but we think it&#39;s going to look much better if it arrives blank vs. being smudged up.\r\n\r\nOAK BARREL MUG FAQ\r\nQ - Are the mugs toasted?\r\nA - Yes, they are lightly toasted.\r\n\r\nQ - Why is my mug leaking?\r\nA - As stated on the product listing, you must cure the mug before use. To cure, fill the mug with hot water and keep it filled for two days until it stops leaking, or until you don&#39;t see the water level change after 24 hours.\r\n\r\nQ - Can the mugs be engraved?\r\nA - Unfortunately, my equipment isn&#39;t set up to engrave the barrel mugs. My suggestion is to make your purchase and have them engraved locally.\r\n\r\nWOODEN SIX PACK CARRIER FAQ\r\nQ - Can I engrave multiple initials on this product? On both sides?\r\nA - Unfortunately, I can only engrave a single large initial on one side of the product. This is due to the way my equipment is set up.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1421102235,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/themanregistry?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/6661096\/iusb_760x100.14676080_r5qu.jpg","num_favorers":485,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null}},{"listing_id":197429018,"state":"active","user_id":28797920,"category_id":69196269,"title":"WHISKINIS!

Stephanie Spann\r\n\r\nUse the &quot;zoom&quot; button on the images above to see the how crisp and high quality the image is. The preview function doesn&#39;t do it justice :) The second image in the listing is the raw photograph. The image may crop slightly depending on what size you order.  The first image is the approximate way the canvas will look in the square dimension.\r\n\r\nCustomize this beautiful photo by choosing whether you would like the image as the original color or if you would like it black and white for a classy, sophisticated look.\r\n\r\nThe photograph is by Stephanie Spann, but I use a professional printing service that ships directly to you.  This means that you receive a beautiful, original piece of artwork at a very low, affordable price.  No extra hassle for you! \r\n\r\nWhat you will receive:\r\n- The image is gallery wrapped with 1.25 inch depth \r\n- Solid backing: Every frame is built with a solid face to support the canvas.  This means it will never deform or loosen.  No staples.  Every gallery wrapped canvas comes with a sturdy, black backer board (pictured in the third image of this listing).  \r\n- Hanging hardware is pre-installed.\r\n\r\nPremium Quality Materials!\r\n- Geniuine Artist Canvas - Features a classic texture and distinctive artistic look.\r\n- Eight Color Inkjet Printing - These pigment based inks provide a beautiful look with exceptional fade resistance.  Vibrant and accurate color resolution.\r\n- Ultimate Protection - Every canvas print is finished off with a clear acrylic coating.  This provides a very scratch resistant protective layer for your artwork with a satin luster finish.\r\n\r\n*This is how the image will look in the dimensions offered in this listing.  It is a perfect square with the image wrapped around the outside.\r\n\r\nAvailable in the following sizes:\r\n6&quot; x 6&quot; = $25\r\n10&quot; x 10&quot; = $45\r\n12&quot; x 12&quot; = $48\r\n16&quot; x 16&quot; = $60 \r\n24&quot; x 24&quot; = $105\r\n\r\n*To see this listing in a regular 8x10 dimension or larger, please follow this link: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/165185507\/wine-liquor-bar-sign-bottles-sepia-home\r\n\r\n*To see this listing in a large, panoramic view, please follow this link: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/173104983\/large-canvas-print-20-x-60-or-12-x-36?ref=shop_home_active\r\n*************************************************************************\r\n\r\nAs always, if you have any questions, please just message me!  \r\n\r\nTo see other photos available for canvas printing, please visit my shop:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/ssstudiosshop?ref=si_shop\r\n\r\n*************************************************************************\r\nThank you so much for visiting my shop!\r\n~Stephanie","creation_tsz":1421865637,"ending_tsz":1432230037,"original_creation_tsz":1385750554,"last_modified_tsz":1421865637,"price":"25.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":198,"tags":["wine canvas art","rum bottle art","liquor bottle art","rustic home decor","living room wall art","fine art","original photography","bar home decor","bar wall print","bar wall art","16 x 16","large canvas print"],"category_path":["Art","Photography","Digital"],"category_path_ids":[68887312,69154867,68925630],"materials":["canvas"],"shop_section_id":15359000,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1418000436,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/171134453\/square-large-canvas-wine-rum-bottle?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":224,"num_favorers":25,"shipping_template_id":924543679,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2000_2009","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":700941200,"hex_code":"897366","red":137,"green":115,"blue":102,"hue":22,"saturation":25,"brightness":53,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1418933627,"listing_id":171134453,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8543032\/il_75x75.700941200_1d6w.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8543032\/il_170x135.700941200_1d6w.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8543032\/il_570xN.700941200_1d6w.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8543032\/il_fullxfull.700941200_1d6w.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":692842987,"hex_code":"62544B","red":98,"green":84,"blue":75,"hue":23,"saturation":23,"brightness":38,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1417469159,"listing_id":171134453,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8543032\/il_75x75.692842987_l1qa.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8543032\/il_170x135.692842987_l1qa.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8543032\/il_570xN.692842987_l1qa.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8543032\/il_fullxfull.692842987_l1qa.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":523910065,"hex_code":"9A8789","red":154,"green":135,"blue":137,"hue":354,"saturation":12,"brightness":60,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1385750554,"listing_id":171134453,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8543032\/il_75x75.523910065_4fz0.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8543032\/il_170x135.523910065_4fz0.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8543032\/il_570xN.523910065_4fz0.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8543032\/il_fullxfull.523910065_4fz0.jpg","full_height":405,"full_width":452},{"listing_image_id":523842146,"hex_code":"786962","red":120,"green":105,"blue":98,"hue":19,"saturation":18,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1385750554,"listing_id":171134453,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/8543032\/il_75x75.523842146_sm6x.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/8543032\/il_170x135.523842146_sm6x.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/8543032\/il_570xN.523842146_sm6x.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/8543032\/il_fullxfull.523842146_sm6x.jpg","full_height":400,"full_width":465}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8543032,"shop_name":"caughtitoncanvas","user_id":37241736,"creation_tsz":1378428556,"title":"Caught It On Canvas","announcement":"Welcome to Caught It On Canvas!
