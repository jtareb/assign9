"title": "Isle of Lewis (Replica) Chess Set, Customisable Colours (Pieces only/Board not included)) Governor Walking Dead, Harry Potter",
"description": "Originally molded from the pieces themselves this is the replica version of the Lewis set.\r\nArguably one of the most famous of the recovered chess sets. The originals were discovered buried on the Isle of Lewis by a farmer in 1831 although the exact nature of their discovery is as shrouded in tales and theories as their reason for being there. Carved for the most part from walrus tusk the set is thought to have been made in the 12th century and shows not only a level of skill and artistry but a unique understanding of character. Most likely of Norwegian origin the 78 pieces 67 of which are in the British museum and 11 of which are in the Museum of Scotland give us several incomplete sets with different queens, kings, rooks etc these are representations of some of those pieces. \r\nWhen first discovered some of the pieces were described as being a deep red which is why i have done the set here in the traditional colors of mahogany and stained sandstone.\r\n\r\nCAMEOS:\r\nIsle of Lewis is the exact set* Ron and Harry can be seen playing with in the Great Hall in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE (in the traditional colour palette seen here) although sadly i do not currently posses the ability to elevate it to wizards chess :)\r\nIt can also be seen in season 4 of THE WALKING DEAD in Black and Aged White (i can also add an eye-patch to the white king for the &quot;Governor&quot; piece) \r\nChoose Harry Potter for Sandstone/Mahogany or Walking Dead for Black/White from the colour selection \r\n*being the replica version there are some slight differences to the one seen (to knowledgeable eye)\r\nfor the Exact set seen in both Harry Potter and Walking dead see my other Isle of Lewis Listing.\r\n\r\nYou can choose any of the three pawn styles to go with your set\r\n\r\nPICTURED 4TH PHOTO: \r\nBack Left to right: Antique Gold, Mahogany, Sandstone Stain, Copper. German silver\r\nFront: Sandalwood, Silver\r\nFINAL PHOTO : Pawn 1 pawn 2 Pawn 3\r\n\r\nThe set is Made to order and takes at least 2 weeks from casting to completion.\r\nThis listing includes the pieces only the boards are just too heavy to feasibly send.\r\nEach piece is Cold-Cast by hand using Tufstone a polymer modified gypsum cement, then painted, glazed and felt bottoms attached.\r\nThis set requires a board with at least a 2&quot; squares,\r\nThe King is 3 5/8&quot; inches tall the Pawns are 1.1 5/8&quot; 2. 2 &quot; 3. 2&quot;\r\n\r\nChoose your favorite colour from the selection and then just let me know what you would like as your opposing colour. If you don&#39;t see a colour you crave there feel free to ask i might be able to do it.\r\n\r\nWe make each piece as strong as possible handled correctly they will last a lifetime but will break if dropped on a concrete floor for instance.\r\nWe ship in flat rate boxes as the sets are very heavy and do our utmost to wrap each piece as securely as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to ship internationally but the even the flat rate tends to be pretty expensive. Feel free to inquire and i can see how much shipping would be to your country or if i know a seller closer to you.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking, feel free to email with any questions. :)",

"title": "1830&#39;s Barn Beam Chess Set in Wormy Chestnut",
"description": "Beautiful one of a kind hand made Chess set. This  Chess set is made using American Wormy Chestnut reclaimed from beams that were once in a 1830&#39;s Ohio barn. The American Chestnut trees were pretty much wiped out by a blight in the late 1800&#39;s into the early 1900&#39;s. Wood from these nearly extinct trees is very rare and valuable, please Google search &quot; American Chestnut Tree Blight&quot; to read the facinating history of this rare wood. Its really cool to own a piece of history that you know was chopped down and used by one of our Pioneer Forefathers.\r\n\r\nThis set measures 2 3/4&#39;&#39; tall and 16&#39;&#39; square. The side frame of this set is made using American Wormy Chesnut , the top edge  still has the swirl marks from the early steam engine saw that turned the tree trunks into beams and the sides are planed and sanded smooth.\r\n\r\n  The side frame has a beautiful chocolate colored oil finish.   A cool feature of the side frame  is it has bunches of the worm holes from the pin worms that lived in the live trees and gave this wood rare wood its name, Wormy Chestnut .these are visible in first photo. This side frame also has some cool old burled knots, one is shown in the third  photo.\r\n\r\nI try to use sections of beams that have a cool feature from the original post and beam construction.  The first photo has several of these great features. That photo shows a peg hole  which still has the original peg embedded in it.. The Pioneer builder would of carved these pegs buy hand with a draw knife which gives it a kind of stop sign shape, these pegs held the beams together.  That first photo shows a very shallow cut out mortise pocket on the top edge, its pretty shallow so maybe it was for a big hinge or something. You can also see a beautiful burled knot and some tiny worm holes in that first photo.\r\n\r\nThe top is made from planks which are also Wormy Chestnut. . I divide the squares with saw kerfs that are 1/8&#39;&#39; wide and  1/4&#39;&#39; deep, these squares are stained alternating with natural and deep walnut colored stain. This top has a bunch of cool old black nail hole where the iron nail has bled diiscoloration into the wood over many generations and a few worm holes and tracks. I have shown these in the fourth photo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chess pieces are imported (from India) wood carved in the traditional French Staunton style. The detail on these is fantastic, the white are Boxwood and the dark ones are Rosewood. The Kings are 3 1/4&#39;&#39; tall with 1 1/4&#39;&#39; diameter base,  the Pawns are 1 1/2&#39;&#39;tall and 1&#39;&#39; diameter with felt on the bottom of all pieces. These pieces come in a draw string pouch with a pamphlet on the rules of chess.\r\n\r\nEach set is marked on the underside the wood species, specific name and history of the \r\nbarn which it came from. Each set is also signed and numbered, zoom in on the photo to see this information.Each set comes with a brochure telling the history of American Wormy Chestnut. This brochure also features photos of the original barn, photo of it coming down, and a photo of the Condos that are now on that site. I have also found and included a copy of a local 1982 newspaper article about this barn and its then owner, Farmer Harold Winston, he mentions its 150 years old at that time. I include a framed photo of the barn taken in the1940&#39;s, it was being used as a saw mill and has giant tree trunks stacked up out front.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy making these beautiful Chess sets. Please click on my &#39;&#39;Feedback&#39;&#39; and you will see previous buyers saying, (and I quote), AWESTRUCK !, LOVE IT, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL, GREAT SELLER.  Every feedback is 5 stars.\r\n\r\nThis set is a great one of a kind gift for any History Buff, Woodworker, or Barn/Farm lover.\r\n\r\n                                      SURE TO BECOME A FAMILY HEIRLOOM\r\n\r\n                                      SHIPS ANYWHERE IN USA FOR $19.50\r\n\r\n                                           I only ship within the United States",

"title": "1830&#39;s Barn Beam Chess Set in Wormy Chestnut",
"description": "Beautiful one of a kind hand made Chess set. This  Chess set is made using American Wormy Chestnut reclaimed from beams that were once in a 1830&#39;s Ohio barn. The American Chestnut trees were pretty much wiped out by a blight in the late 1800&#39;s into the early 1900&#39;s. Wood from these nearly extinct trees is very rare and valuable, please Google search &quot; American Chestnut Tree Blight&quot; to read the facinating history of this rare wood. Its really cool to own a piece of history that you know was chopped down and used by one of our Pioneer Forefathers.\r\n\r\nThis set measures 2 3/4&#39;&#39; tall and 16&#39;&#39; square. The side frame of this set is made using American Wormy Chesnut that I have planed smooth  on the sides and top edge still has the swirl marks from the early steam engine saw that turned the tree trunks into beams .\r\n  The side frame has a beautiful chocolate colored oil finish.   A cool feature of the side frame  is it has bunches of the worm holes from the pin worms that lived in the live trees and gave this wood rare wood its name, Wormy Chestnut .these are visible in first photo. \r\n\r\nI try to use sections of beams that have a cool feature from the original post and beam construction.  This piece has a shallow hand chiseled mortise pocket cut on one side.\r\nThis is shown in the first photo, there is also a peg hole  and I include a slice of a wood peg. The Pioneer builder would of carved these pegs buy hand with a draw knife which gives it a kind of stop sign shape, these pegs held the beams together.   A real cool feature is you can see the builders original scribed lay out lines on the top edge matking the length of the pocket to be carved out.\r\n\r\nThe top is made from planks which are also Wormy Chestnut. . I divide the squares with saw kerfs that are 1/8&#39;&#39; wide and  1/4&#39;&#39; deep, these squares are stained alternating with natural and deep walnut colored stain. This top has a couple cool old black nail holes where the iron nail has bled diiscoloration into the wood over many generations and a few worm holes and tracks, there is also a cool swirled burled knot, all these  I have shown in the third photo. The underside still has some old whitw wash paint, straight from Tom Sawyer days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chess pieces are imported (from India) wood carved in the traditional French Staunton style. The detail on these is fantastic, the white are Boxwood and the dark ones are Rosewood. The Kings are 3 1/4&#39;&#39; tall with 1 1/4&#39;&#39; diameter base,  the Pawns are 1 1/2&#39;&#39;tall and 1&#39;&#39; diameter with felt on the bottom of all pieces. These pieces come in a draw string pouch with a pamphlet on the rules of chess.\r\n\r\nEach set is marked on the underside the wood species, specific name and history of the \r\nbarn which it came from. Each set is also signed and numbered, zoom in on the photo to see this information.Each set comes with a brochure telling the history of American Wormy Chestnut. This brochure also features photos of the original barn, photo of it coming down, and a photo of the Condos that are now on that site. I have also found and included a copy of a local 1982 newspaper article about this barn and its then owner, Farmer Harold Winston, he mentions its 150 years old at that time. I include a framed photo of the barn taken in the1940&#39;s, it was being used as a saw mill and has giant tree trunks stacked up out front.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy making these beautiful Chess sets. Please click on my &#39;&#39;Feedback&#39;&#39; and you will see previous buyers saying, (and I quote), AWESTRUCK !, LOVE IT, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL, GREAT SELLER.  Every feedback is 5 stars.\r\n\r\nThis set is a great one of a kind gift for any History Buff, Woodworker, or Barn/Farm lover.\r\n\r\n                                      SURE TO BECOME A FAMILY HEIRLOOM\r\n\r\n                                      SHIPS ANYWHERE IN USA FOR $19.50\r\n\r\n                                           I only ship within the United States",

"description": "‚Ä¢\tThe chess and backgammon combo set is handmade in one of the most beautiful natural grain hard woods - Indian rosewood, also known as &quot;Sheesham&quot;.\r\n‚Ä¢\tThe set is magnetic, so the pieces will move only when players make a move and not with the bumps in your ride. If playing at home, you can make your game last for days...\r\n‚Ä¢\tThe chessmen and backgammon pieces are sized logically to match the size of the chess board and each chessman has its own designated storage place within the board. This helps that you do not loose any piece and it&#39;s easy to carry along.\r\n‚Ä¢\tWhen not being played, it makes for an excellent decor piece and will match just about any kind of decor. It makes horse sense to own one and it&#39;s a great gift for anyone on any occasion! Everyone will just love this family board game.\r\n‚Ä¢\tBoard size - unfolded: length - 12 x width - 12 x height - 1 inches; folded: length - 12 x width - 6 x height - 2 inches",

"description": "Carved in  12th Century Norway, buried for 700 years, and then uncovered on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, the Lewis Chessmen remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nAll 78 chessmen are unique - some with worried expressions, some sad or glum, and others (especially the Queens, with their long and intricate braids) evincing wisdom and repose.  The wild-eyed Beserkers biting their shields with battle fury display ferocity- or perhaps drug-induced frenzy.\r\n\r\nOur new line of Lewis Chessmen furniture celebrates the hearts and souls of the Chessmen.\r\n\r\nThe chairs - two large mahogany carvers and four smaller seats - are beautifully restored antique pieces polished to a lustre just one step up from matte. The seats and backs are traditionally upholstered for decades of enjoyment\r\n\r\nOriginal graphic art printed on cotton - linen  in the USA.",
